On Graph Critique<br />
I try to Summarize the percentage of flights, departing from Denver airport, delayed 15 minutes, and more<br />
Also in the second graph, I summarizing the flight volume and fights delayed, by date and showing weekly cycles<br />
On the Freestyle analysis<br />
I used the joint distribution of continuous variables in the scatterplot matrix.<br />
Finally in Graphical "Lineup<br />
I use Permutation statistical to check the null hypothesis: The proportion of delayed flights per month is independent across months.
